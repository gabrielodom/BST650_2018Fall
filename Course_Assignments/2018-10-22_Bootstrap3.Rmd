## Bootstrap Assignment 3: Due Sunday, 28 October at 23:59PM
*For help with Rmarkdown for reports, see this [white paper](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/rmarkdown/#math-in-r-markdown) from Carnegie Mellon University's Department of Statistics and Data Science.*

Read this chapter on functions and if/else statements in R:
http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html

Create a markdown report where you execute the code from this chapter, and attempt the exercises after each section. Some of them will be more challenging than others, but I still want you to try to solve them.
